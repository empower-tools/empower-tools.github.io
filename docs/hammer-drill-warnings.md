### SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL OPERATIONS
* Wear ear protectors when impact drilling. Exposure to noise can cause hearing loss.
* Use the auxiliary handle(s). Loss of control can cause personal injury. 
* Brace the tool properly before use. This tool produces a  high  output  torque  and  without  properly  bracing  the  tool during operation loss of control may occur resulting in personal injury. 
* Hold the power tool by insulated gripping surfaces, when  performing  an  operation  where  the  cutting  accessory  or  fasteners  may  contact  hidden  wiring.  Cutting accessory contacting a  “live”  wire may make exposed metal parts of the power tool  “live” and could give the operator an electric shock.
* Know  your  power  tool.  Read  operator’s  manual  carefully.  Learn  its  applications  and  limitations,  as  well as the specific potential hazards related to this power  tool.  Following  this  rule  will  reduce  the  risk  of  electric shock, fire, or serious injury.

### SAFETY  INSTRUCTIONS  WHEN  USING  LONG  DRILL BITS
* Never  operate  at  higher  speed  than  the  maximum  speed rating of the drill bit. At higher speeds, the bit is likely to bend if allowed to rotate freely without contacting the workpiece, resulting in personal injury.
* Always  start  drilling  at  low  speed  and  with  the  bit  tip  in  contact  with  the  workpiece.  At  higher  speeds,  the bit is likely to bend if allowed to rotate freely without contacting the workpiece, resulting in personal injury.
* Apply pressure only in direct line with the bit and do not apply excessive pressure. Bits can bend causing breakage or loss of control, resulting in personal injury.
## IMPACT DRIVER
* Hold power tool by insulated gripping surfaces, when performing an operation where the fastener may con-tact  hidden  wiring.  Fasteners contacting a “live” wire may make exposed metal parts of the power tool “live” and could give the operator an electric shock.
* Wear  ear  protectors  with  impact  drills.  Exposure  to  noise can cause hearing loss.
### ADDITIONAL SAFETY RULES
* Know your power tool. Read operator’s manual care-fully. Learn its applications and limitations, as well as the  specific  potential  hazards  related  to  this  power  tool. Following  this  rule  will  reduce  the  risk  of  electric  shock, fire, or serious injury.
* Always wear eye protection with side shields marked to  comply  with  ANSI  Z87.1  when  assembling  parts,  operating the tool, or performing maintenance. Fol-lowing this rule will reduce the risk of serious personal injury.
* Protect your lungs. Wear a face or dust mask if the operation is dusty. Following this rule will reduce the risk of serious personal injury.
* Protect your hearing. Wear hearing protection during extended periods of operation. Following this rule will reduce the risk of serious personal injury.
* Battery tools do not have to be plugged into an elec-trical outlet; therefore, they are always in operating condition.  Be  aware  of  possible  hazards  when  not  using your battery tool or when changing accessories. Following this rule will reduce the risk of electric shock, fire, or serious personal injury.
* Do not place battery tools or their batteries near fire or heat. This will reduce the risk of explosion and pos-sibly injury.
* Do not crush, drop or damage battery pack. Do not use a battery pack or charger that has been dropped or received a sharp blow. A damaged battery is subject to explosion. Properly dispose of a dropped or damaged battery immediately.
* Batteries  can  explode  in  the  presence  of  a  source  of ignition, such as a pilot light. To reduce the risk of serious personal injury, never use any cordless product in the presence of open flame. An exploded battery can propel debris and chemicals. If exposed, flush with water immediately.
* Do not charge battery tool in a damp or wet location. Do not use, store, or charge battery packs or products in locations where the temperature is less than 50°F or more than 100°F. Do not store outside or in vehicles. 
* Under extreme usage or temperature conditions, bat-tery leakage may occur. If liquid comes in contact with your skin, wash immediately with soap and water. If liquid gets into your eyes, flush them with clean water for at least 10 minutes, then seek immediate medical attention. Following this rule will reduce the risk of seri-ous personal injury.
* Save these instructions. Refer to them frequently and use them to instruct others who may use this tool. If you loan someone this tool, loan them these instructions also.
