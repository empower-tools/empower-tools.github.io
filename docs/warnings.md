# General Power Tool Safety Warnings
:::danger
## WARNING
Read  all  safety  warnings,  instructions,  illustrations  and  specifications  provided  with  this  power  tool.  Failure  to  follow  all  instructions  listed below may result in electric shock, fire and/or serious injury.
:::

**Save all warnings and instructions for future reference.**

The term “power tool” in the warnings refers to your mains-operated (corded) power tool or battery-operated (cordless) power tool.

### WORK AREA SAFETY
* Keep  work  area  clean  and  well  lit.  Cluttered  or  dark  areas invite accidents.
* Do not operate power tools in explosive atmospheres, such as in the presence of flammable liquids, gases or dust. Power tools create sparks which may ignite the dust or fumes.
* Keep children and bystanders away while operating a power tool. Distractions can cause you to lose control.
### ELECTRICAL SAFETY
* Power tool plugs must match the outlet. Never modify the plug in any way. Do not use any adapter plugs with earthed (grounded) power tools. Unmodified plugs and matching outlets will reduce risk of electric shock.
* Avoid body contact with earthed or grounded surfac-es, such as pipes, radiators, ranges and refrigerators. There is an increased risk of electric shock if your body is earthed or grounded.
* Do not expose power tools to rain or wet conditions. Water entering a power tool will increase the risk of elec-tric shock.
* Do not abuse the cord. Never use the cord for carrying, pulling or unplugging the power tool. Keep cord away from heat, oil, sharp edges or moving parts. Damaged or entangled cords increase the risk of electric shock.
* When operating a power tool outdoors, use an exten-sion cord suitable for outdoor use. Use of a cord suit-able for outdoor use reduces the risk of electric shock.
* If operating a power tool in a damp location is unavoid-able, use a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) pro-tected supply. Use of a GFCI reduces the risk of electric shock.
* Use this product only with batteries and chargers listed in  tool/appliance/battery  pack/charger  correlation  supplement 988000-302.
### PERSONAL SAFETY
* Stay alert, watch what you are doing and use com-mon sense when operating a power tool. Do not use a power tool while you are tired or under the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication. A moment of inatten-tion  while  operating  power  tools  may  result  in  serious  personal injury.
* Use personal protective equipment. Always wear eye protection.  Protective  equipment  such  as  dust  mask,  non-skid  safety  shoes,  hard  hat,  or  hearing  protection  used  for  appropriate  conditions  will  reduce  personal  injuries.
* Prevent unintentional starting. Ensure the switch is in the off-position before connecting to power source and/or battery pack, picking up or carrying the tool. Carrying  power  tools  with  your  finger  on  the  switch  or  energizing  power  tools  that  have  the  switch  on  invites  accidents.
* Remove any adjusting key or wrench before turning the power tool on. A wrench or a key left attached to a rotating part of the power tool may result in personal injury.
* Do not overreach. Keep proper footing and balance at all times. This enables better control of the power tool in unexpected situations.
* Dress properly. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry. Keep your hair, clothing and gloves away from moving parts. Loose clothes, jewelry or long hair can be caught in moving parts.
* If  devices  are  provided  for  the  connection  of  dust  extraction and collection facilities, ensure these are connected  and  properly  used.  Use  of  dust  collection  can reduce dust-related hazards.
* Do not let familiarity gained from frequent use of tools allow  you  to  become  complacent  and  ignore  tool  safety  principles.  A  careless  action  can  cause  severe  injury within a fraction of a second.
* Do  not  wear  loose  clothing  or  jewelry.  Contain  long  hair.  Loose  clothes,  jewelry,  or  long  hair  can  be  drawn  into air vents.
* Do  not  use  on  a  ladder  or  unstable  support.  Stable footing  on  a  solid  surface  enables  better  control  of  the  power tool in unexpected situations.
### POWER TOOL USE AND CARE
* Do not force the power tool. Use the correct power tool  for  your  application.  The  correct  power  tool  will  do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was designed.
* Do not use the power tool if the switch does not turn it on and off. Any power tool that cannot be controlled with the switch is dangerous and must be repaired.
* Disconnect  the  plug  from  the  power  source  and/or remove the battery pack, if detachable, from the power tool before making any adjustments, changing accessories, or storing power tools.Such preventive safety measures reduce the risk of starting the power tool accidentally.
* Store idle power tools out of the reach of children and do not allow persons unfamiliar with the power tool or these instructions to operate the power tool. Power tools are dangerous in the hands of untrained users.
* Maintain  power  tools  and  accessories.  Check  for  misalignment  or  binding  of  moving  parts,  breakage  of parts and any other condition that may affect the power tool’s operation. If damaged, have the power tool repaired before use. Many accidents are caused by poorly maintained power tools.
* Keep  cutting  tools  sharp  and  clean.  Properly  main-tained  cutting  tools  with  sharp  cutting  edges  are  less  likely to bind and are easier to control.
* Use  the  power  tool,  accessories  and  tool  bits  etc.  in  accordance  with  these  instructions,  taking  into  account the working conditions and the work to be performed. Use of the power tool for operations different from those intended could result in a hazardous situation.
* Keep handles and grasping surfaces dry, clean and free from oil and grease. Slippery handles and grasping surfaces do not allow for safe handling and control of the tool in unexpected situations.
### BATTERY TOOL USE AND CARE
* Recharge  only  with  the  charger  specified  by  the  manufacturer. A  charger  that  is  suitable  for  one  type  of battery pack may create a risk of fire when used with another battery pack.
* Use power tools only with specifically designated bat-tery packs. Use of any other battery packs may create a risk of injury and fire.
* When battery pack is not in use, keep it away from other metal objects, like paper clips, coins, keys, nails, screws or other small metal objects, that can make a connection from one terminal to another. Shorting the battery terminals together may cause burns or a fire.
* Under  abusive  conditions,  liquid  may  be  ejected  from the battery; avoid contact. If contact acciden-tally occurs, flush with water. If liquid contacts eyes, additionally seek medical help. Liquid ejected from the battery may cause irritation or burns.
* Do not use a battery pack or tool that is damaged or modified. Damaged  or  modified  batteries  may  exhibit  unpredictable behavior resulting in fire, explosion, or risk of injury.
* Do  not  expose  a  battery  pack  or  tool  to  fire  or  excessive temperature. Exposure to fire or temperature above 265°F may cause explosion.
* Follow all charging instructions and do not charge the battery  pack  or  tool  outside  the  temperature  range  specified in the instructions. Charging improperly or at temperatures outside the specified range may damage the battery and increase the risk of fire.
### SERVICE
* Have your power tool serviced by a qualified repair person  using  only  identical  replacement  parts.  This will ensure that the safety of the power tool is maintained.
* Never  service  damaged  battery  packs.  Service of  battery  packs  should  only  be  performed  by  the  manufacturer or authorized service providers.
